The DR-4 LRIR is a longer range reflective distance sensor showcasing the Vishay TSSP6038. The TSSP6038 includes a signal conditioning section to demodulate a 38kHz carrier for light source disturbance immunity (for example, changing sunlight or fluorescent illumination). An IR emitter and support circuitry complete this sensor evaluation solution. Two options are available for either a simple digital signal output (TSSP6038), or a variable pulsewidth "analog" output (TSSP6P38).
